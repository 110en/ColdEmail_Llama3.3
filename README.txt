Hi :D

All you need is the app folder, everything else is unnecessary for this to work. Make sure that you have a valid groq api key and edit the .env file so that it contains your key. Do not add "" around it.

The user inputs a job post url, in which then the site is scraped for vital info relating to the position and a cold email is generated by the llm (changes based on your key). The email also contains
links to supposed portfolios that showcase relevant work related to the skills and expertise that the job post is asking for. If you want to change the links to your own, simply edit the my_portfolio.csv file. The emails are generated so that OpenAI is supposedly the author and sending it to the company behind the job post. Make sure the url you are inputting is a valid url that is linked to a currently existing job post.
Note: Due to the temperature being set to 0, rerunning the application may result in identical or very simiilar responses. You can change this setting in chain.py.

For it to work, in the command prompt type: streamlit run <path to main.py>. If for whatever reason command prompt doesn't allow streamlit commands, use: python -m streamlit run <path to main.py>.

Packages used in this program (not necessarily exhaustive):
- streamlit
- langchain
    - _community
    - _groq
    - _core
- pyhon-dotenv
- pandas
- chromadb
